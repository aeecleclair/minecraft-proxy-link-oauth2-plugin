## 📦 OAuth2Client - Seamless OAuth2 Integration for Velocity and Paper

**OAuth2Client** is a lightweight, modern plugin that provides seamless, real-time integration between your Velocity Minecraft server and your OIDC provider.

With OAuth2Client, players can securely link their Minecraft accounts with your OIDC provider using OAuth2 — no need to manually enter codes.

### ✨ Key Features
